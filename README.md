  - I added a reset.css file to run before anything, and even thought it altered the look of the page slightly I thought it would be best to just include it to be consistent.

  - I wanted to add a media query so that the children in the "header div" will change the text to a smaller size when screen reached bellow 600px, however for the life of me I couldnt figure out what was stopping it from working. It is commented out on the bottom of style.css.

  - I also had an issue where my site looked different when I would load it into my browser using the live server plugin vs. when I would open into a default browser. Despite them pulling from the same file structure, they would still behave differently. I believe what was uploaded to my Gitpages is this new, larger format than I initially had, so please refer to the screenshots for the layout that showed for me.
