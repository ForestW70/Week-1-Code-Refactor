Homework 1 - Forest Wilson

<!-- Goal -->

To clean up the code in a way to make it function identically to the original files, while cutting out code that is not needed and making it an easier project to work with.

<!-- User story -->

As a customer
I want a page that is highly visible with easy-to-read sections,
so that I can navigate the links quickly and efficiently.

As a developer
I want the project files to show accurate semantics and comments when needed,
So that I can quickly Get a big-picture view and figure out what is going on.

I want The project file to have no redundancies in their class, IDs, and other selectors,
So that we can maintain a highly efficient sight, increasing our search engine score.

As a marketing agency
I want a page that is as compliant with all accessibility standards as possible,
So that we can deliver the site to a wider audience, increasing total clicks, and possibly revenue.

As a customer who requires ADA features
I want a site that has large, clear areas of interaction and non-colliding text elements,
So that any my viewfinder/device will not get confused and hopefully I wonâ€™t get confused.

 <!-- Additional comments -->

 I added a reset.css file to run before anything, and even thought it altered the look of the page slightly I thought it would be best to just include it to be consistent.

I wanted to add a media query so that the children in the "header div" will change the text to a smaller size when screen reached bellow 600px, however for the life of me I couldnt figure out what was stopping it from working. It is commented out on the bottom of style.css.

<meta name="viewport"> line was a meta tag that seemed like it was working for others with similar problems, but I don't believe it helped any.

I also had an issue where my site looked different when I would load it into my browser using the live server plugin vs. when I would open into a default browser. Despite them pulling from the same file structure, they would still behave differently. I believe what was uploaded to my Gitpages is this new, larger format than I initially had, so please refer to the screenshots for the layout that showed for me.

I think I may have an issue with chrome so I will try and redownload it and see if that helps anything.
